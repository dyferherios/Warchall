## Py-tong
A fellow hacker is challenging you to exploit a simple python script.
To exploit it live, you have to create your Warchall account and try your luck there.
To see what it is about you can also view the source here.

Note: It is not required to trigger a race condition, but it should work as well.
Note: You have to use the binary "pytong" not the pytong.py. It is a wrapper which is needed for SETREGID and finally gives the solution.
### Level 12
To solve this challenge, the following command is used: ./pytong <(echo text)

./pytong: This is the execution of the pytong binary, which is the Python script to exploit
<: This is the redirection operator; it takes the output of the following command and uses it as input for ./pytong.
(echo text): This generates the string "text" and passes it as input to ./pytong
```bash
./pytong <(echo text)
```
